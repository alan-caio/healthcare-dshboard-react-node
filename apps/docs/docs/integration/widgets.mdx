# Widgets

## Manual

You can implement your running dash. instance on your websites and personal dashboards, via iframes that
can be configured using query parameters.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://<YOUR_SERVER_URL>/?singleGraphMode=true&graph=cpu&multiView=true"
  style="border-radius: 20px"
></iframe>
```

## Parameters

### `singleGraphMode`

This parameter tells dash. that it should only show a single graph in full-screen mode.

- type: `boolean`
- required: `true`

### `graph`

Select the specific graph that you want to show,

- type: `string` (`cpu`, `storage`, `ram`, `network`, `gpu`)
- required: `true`

### `multiView`

For the `cpu` and `storage` widgets, there are multi-device views.
These can be shown, by passing this parameter.

- type: `boolean`

:::caution

The multi-view for the `storage` widget is opt-in. To check if the installation has this enabled, use
the API Request to `/config`, like [described in the API Section](./api#config)

:::

### `theme`

To override the theme of the graph. If this is not passed, the default theme of the users browser is used.

- type: `string` (`dark`, `light`)

### `color`

To override the color of the graph, passed as a hex string. If this is not passed, the default color of the widget is used.
The color needs to be passed _without_ the trailing `#`.

- type: `string`

### `surface`

To override the background color, passed as a hex string. If this is not passed, the default color of the theme is used.
The color needs to be passed _without_ the trailing `#`.

- type: `string`

### `innerRadius`

This changes the `border-radius` on the graphs. This is mainly needed to add `border-radius` on views with multiple graphs,
like the network graph. If you want to add a bigger `border-radius` to the whole container, just add it to the iframe's styles.

- type: `number`

### `gap`

This changes the `gap` between the graphs. This is mainly needed on views with multiple graphs, like the network graph.

- type: `number`
