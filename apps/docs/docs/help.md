## Q&A

### How can I enable the GPU Widget?

You can use the [`DASHDOT_WIDGET_LIST`](./config#dashdot_widget_list) to add the GPU widget,
by passing a list that includes it (e.g. `os,cpu,storage,ram,network,gpu`). If you are running
on docker though, make sure to also carefully read the [GPU Widget Options](./config/widget-options/graphics).
